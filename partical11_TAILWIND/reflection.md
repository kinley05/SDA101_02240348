## documination
This project creates a simple responsive webpage using Tailwind CSS. The webpage includes a header, main content area, and footer. In the main content, there's a welcome message and a button that changes color and slightly grows when hovered over. Tailwind CSS classes are used to style the elements, ensuring they look good on different screen sizes. The layout adjusts automatically for mobile and desktop views, making it user-friendly. You can open the webpage in a browser and resize the window to see how it adapts to various devices.
