## Documination
This code creates a simple, responsive landing page for an e-commerce site called "TechStore." It includes a navigation bar at the top with links to key sections: Home, Products, About Us, and Contact. The hero section features a large background image with an overlay of welcome text. Below, a product section displays six items in a grid layout, each showing an image, name, and price. At the bottom, the footer contains links to the privacy policy, terms of service, and social media icons. The page is styled using CSS for a clean and modern design, with responsive features to ensure it looks good on tablets, desktops, and smaller screens. The layout uses semantic HTML elements to make the structure easy to understand.
