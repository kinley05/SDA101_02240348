This HTML code creates a table to help you track your grades throughout the semester. The table includes columns for the module name, assignment or exam name, maximum marks, marks obtained, percentage, and grade. You can fill in the table with your specific grades for each assignment or exam. The table is organized and easy to read, making it simple for you to see your progress in each subject. You can add or remove rows as needed to keep your grade information up to date.

## what i learn 
In this project, I learned how to create an HTML table to track grades for my classes. I discovered how to organize information clearly by using rows and columns. I also practiced using HTML tags like <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> to structure the data. This helped me understand how to display my grades and keep everything organized, making it easier to see my progress in each subject.

## challenges 
While working on this project, I faced a few challenges. First, I had to figure out how to format the table correctly so that it looked clear and organized. Sometimes, I made mistakes with the HTML tags, which made the table not display properly. I also struggled with calculating the percentage and grade based on the marks obtained. It took some time to understand how to do these calculations, but I eventually figured it out. Overall, these challenges helped me learn more about HTML and data organization.
