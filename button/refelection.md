## Project Summary
Creating a custom checkbox involved designing an HTML structure with a hidden default checkbox and styling it to resemble a toggle switch using CSS. The project introduced SVG icons and animations to enhance interactivity and visual appeal.

## Key Challenges
Customizing Checkbox Appearance: Hiding the default checkbox and designing a switch-like appearance required precise control over styles, positioning, and pseudo-elements.
Implementing SVG Icons: Using inline SVGs as icons in the ::after pseudo-element was a new approach, allowing me to customize icons for both checked and unchecked states.
Animating the Toggle: Animating the toggle handleâ€™s position on check/uncheck added a layer of complexity, especially in synchronizing the SVG icon and handle movement.

## Key Learning Outcomes
Advanced CSS Techniques: This project strengthened my understanding of pseudo-elements, CSS transitions, and the appearance property, which are essential for customizing form controls.
Working with Inline SVGs: Embedding SVG data directly in CSS was a valuable technique, making it easy to change icons without additional image files.
Creating Accessible Controls: The use of a label element with a for attribute improved accessibility and made the toggle easier to use.
Future Improvements
In the future, I could enhance the project by adding JavaScript for more dynamic interactions or experimenting with alternative animations to further refine the user experience.
