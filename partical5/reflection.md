## Documation
This project is a simple HTML table that represents a weekly course schedule. It shows time slots as rows and days of the week as columns, with subjects like "Math" and "English" as examples. Basic CSS styling is used to make the table clear and organized, with borders, background colors, and padding. You can customize the subjects or style by editing the code. The schedule is easy to view in a browser and can be improved by adding responsiveness or interactivity in the future.

## What i learn
From this code, I learned how to create and structure an HTML table using rows and columns to organize data clearly. I also practiced using basic CSS to style the table, such as adding borders, background colors, and padding to make it easy to read. This project helped me understand how to plan and present information in a simple, organized way, while also thinking about ways to improve it, like making it responsive or interactive.

## challenges
challenges i faced:
Table Structure: Figuring out how to organize the rows and columns for time slots and days of the week.
CSS Styling: Deciding how to style the table to make it look clean and easy to read.
Content Planning: Choosing example subjects or activities to fill the schedule in a meaningful way.
Alignment and Spacing: Ensuring the text and cells are properly aligned for a neat appearance.
Responsiveness: Thinking about how the table would look on different screen sizes without additional CSS for mobile.

## Reflection
This project helped me understand how to use HTML tables to organize data effectively and apply CSS for better presentation. I learned the importance of clear structure with <thead>, <tbody>, and proper alignment for readability. While styling the table, I realized how small design choices, like padding and colors, improve usability. This exercise also made me think about making the table more dynamic and responsive in the future. Overall, it was a valuable practice in both technical and design skills.
