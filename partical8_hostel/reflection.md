## Documination
This code creates a simple and modern maintenance request form for a hostel. The HTML section defines the structure of the form, which includes fields for the user's name, room number, type of issue, description, and urgency level. Each input has a specific type to make it easy to fill out. The CSS section styles the form to look clean and attractive, using a light background color and rounded corners. It also ensures that the form fields change color when selected, improving user experience. The submit button stands out with a bright color that changes on hover, making it clear and inviting for users to click.

While creating the maintenance request form, I faced a few challenges. One difficulty was ensuring that the form looked good on different screen
sizes, so I had to pay attention to how the layout adjusted. Another challenge was choosing the right colors to make the form visually appealing

careful planning. Lastly, I needed to make sure the focus styles on the input fields worked well for better accessibility and user interaction. Overall, these challenges helped me improve my design and coding skills.
