## documination
This code creates a webpage that displays a list of upcoming college events. The events are shown in an ordered list, where each event includes its name, time, and location in a nested unordered list. The styling is done using CSS to make the events look attractive and easy to read. The default numbering of the list is removed, and each event has a white background with rounded corners and a subtle shadow. When a user hovers over an event, the background changes to a light blue color, and the text color darkens, making it clear which event is being focused on. The layout also includes proper spacing and padding to ensure everything is neatly organized.
## what i learn
In this project, I learned how to create a simple webpage using HTML and CSS. I practiced organizing information in lists, specifically an ordered list for events and a nested unordered list for details like time and location. I also learned how to style these lists with CSS to improve their appearance, such as changing the background color on hover and removing default list styles. This helped I understand how to make content more visually appealing and user-friendly. Overall, I gained skills in web development by combining structure (HTML) and style (CSS).
## challengs
During this project, I faced a few challenges. One difficulty was figuring out how to remove the default numbering from the ordered list while keeping the events organized. I also had to learn how to create hover effects, which required some trial and error to get the colors and transitions just right. Another challenge was ensuring the spacing and padding looked good across different screen sizes. Overall, I had to experiment with CSS properties and adjust them until the layout and design met my expectations. These challenges helped me improve my skills and understand how to better style web pages.
## Reflection 
Reflecting on this project, I feel proud of what I accomplished. I successfully created a visually appealing list of college events and learned valuable skills in HTML and CSS. Overcoming challenges, like styling and formatting, taught me how to problem-solve and be more creative with web design. I also gained a better understanding of how to organize information clearly for users. This experience has boosted my confidence in web development and motivated me to keep learning more about creating and styling websites.
