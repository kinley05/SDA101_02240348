(a) Documentation
Main Concepts Applied
While creating the HTML structure for a non-profit organization website, I focused on a few key concepts:
HTML Structure: I used semantic HTML elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer>, which helped make the content more meaningful and accessible.
Responsive Design: I aimed to ensure that the website looked good on any device, from desktops to smartphones.
User Experience (UX): I wanted to create a smooth and intuitive experience for visitors by organizing the content and making navigation easy.
New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
Throughout this project, I picked up some valuable skills:
Image Optimization: I learned how important it is to use descriptive alt text for images, which helps with accessibility and SEO.
CSS Basics: I gained experience in styling the website, making it visually appealing with buttons and layout designs.
Web Accessibility: I discovered how to use ARIA roles to ensure the site is accessible to all users.

(b) Reflection
What I Learned
This project really solidified my understanding of HTML and CSS. I learned how to build a structured and accessible website that effectively shares a non-profit’s mission with visitors.
Challenges Faced
One major challenge was ensuring the website was responsive. At first, the layout felt cramped on smaller screens. To tackle this, I dove into research on responsive design techniques and applied CSS grid and flexbox, which really helped create a more flexible layout.
I also had some trouble with image sizes. I learned about image optimization, which improved loading times and overall user experience.
