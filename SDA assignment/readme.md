This projict makes a website.
i make it using the help of html and css.
i learned some from the chatgpt and using gooogle.
i learnewd to
 * Understand HTML better
 * Use CSS (or TailwindCSS) to style webpages
 * Make webpages work on all devices (responsiveness)
What's next:
 * I want to try building more complex designs.
 * I'll learn more advanced CSS techniques.
 * Maybe I'll explore a framework like Bootstrap to make responsive design easier.
This project was a great way to improve my front-end developmentÂ skills!
