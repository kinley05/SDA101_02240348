1.What I Did
This project creates a styled list using HTML and CSS. The list is organized into sections, and each main item has a hover effect that changes its background color and text color. Subitems are in nested lists with square bullets.
2.Challenges
Inline styles were used for the nested lists instead of a reusable CSS class.
The <div> inside <li> isn’t the best practice; styling the <li> directly would simplify the code.
The nested lists don’t share the same hover effects as the main items, which could confuse users.
3.Lessons Learned
what i learned:
Using semantic HTML and reusable styles makes the code easier to read and maintain.
Small effects like hover transitions improve user experience.
4.Future Improvements
Make the design more mobile-friendly with responsive styles.
Simplify the HTML structure by removing unnecessary <div> elements.
Improve accessibility by adding proper roles and attributes.
